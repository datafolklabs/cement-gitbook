# Part 1: Creating Your First Project

## Introduction

Throughout this tutorial we will be building a TODO application called `todo`.  We will begin with a barebones template using the `cement generate` tool, and build up from there to cover as much of the core features of the framework as possible.

Our TODO application will include the following features:

* Ability to create, update, delete items
* Persist data using [TinyDB](http://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)
