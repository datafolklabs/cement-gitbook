# Part 1: Creating Your First Project

## Introduction

Throughout this tutorial we will be building a TODO application called `honeydo`.  We will begin with a barebones template using the `cement generate` tool, and build up from there to cover as much of the core features of the framework as possible.

Our `HoneyDo` application will include the following features:

* Ability to create, update, delete, and complete task items
* Persist data using [TinyDB](http://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)
* Send an email message to the wife when tasks are complete
