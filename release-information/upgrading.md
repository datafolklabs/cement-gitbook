# Upgrading

## Upgrading from Cement 2

There is currently no upgrade path directly from Cement 2. Cement 3 is the first iteration of a new/modified codebase and as such breakage was intentionally not a concern.

In general, usage is very similar. However, paths to classes and class names may have changed and will need to be modified. If not married to your existing application layout/design/etc, it would be recommended to start a new project using the `cement generate` developer tools, and move code into it piece by piece.

Data Folk Labs, LLC (the creators of Cement) do offer consulting and development services, and could evaluate the migration of a Cement 2 app over to Cement 3. Please contact us if that is something you'd be interested to inquire about: [team@datafolklabs.com](mailto:%20team@datafolklabs.com).
