# Autocomplete

## Introduction to Autocomplete

Autocomplete, or autosuggest, is a common feature for many command-line applications. Most command-line users are familiar with autocomplete when they type part of a command and press `tab` to complete the rest of the command, or `tab-tab` to see a list of commands matching that prefix.&#x20;

Beyond autocomplete of the command name itself, there are ways to autocomplete sub-commands and/or options and arguments. As support for autocomplete often depends on external applications, and/or the terminal application you are using, autocomplete is a varied topic.

Cement does not currently have any mechanisms to support autocomplete out of the box. This document will serve as a helper for known ways you might find suitable for your needs.
